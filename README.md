📌 TL;DR

This project applies multiple image preprocessing techniques on the entire Artistic Painting Dataset (11k+ images) and visualizes them on sample images. It also includes an additional Neural Style Transfer (Van Gogh) output using a pretrained model. Implemented fully in Google Colab using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
